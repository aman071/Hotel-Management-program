# Hotel-Management-program

The program initiates the user as a hotel employee who has access to the software used at the hotel. 
A password is required to login, just like an admin would log in to a secure browser.
Information about the guest who has to stay at the hotel is noted, like name,age,date of arrival,etc. This is stored in a database. There is also a food menu for guest through which he/she can order food. When food is ordered, price is added to the total bill. Checkout is calculated and total bill according to duration of stay and food bought, is calculated.
